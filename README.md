This project is to replicate a blackjack game using only 1 suit. Additional suits can be added using a key (suit), value (card value) pair instead of just the card value. 
This project will be optimized in the future.

The project contains 3 classes: Game, GameLogic and Runner.
Game: The class that contains the getters and setters for the different variables used in the GameLogic class
GameLogic: The class that contains the logic for the game.
Runner: The class that contains the main method and handles the execution of the game.
